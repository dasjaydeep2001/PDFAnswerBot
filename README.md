In today's digital age, vast amounts of information are stored in various document formats, such as PDFs, making it challenging for users to efficiently extract relevant insights. Despite the abundance of data, traditional methods of document analysis often prove to be time-consuming and labor-intensive. 

Unlike web pages or other digital resources, PDFs do not have the same level of interactivity. Users are often unable to search within the document, make annotations or highlight text, or easily navigate to different sections. This can lead to frustration and disengagement for library users, who may prefer resources with more interactive features. Addressing the problem of PDF interaction in library systems is crucial for improving user engagement and satisfaction. By providing users with more interactive PDFs, libraries can enhance the user experience and increase the likelihood that users will return to the library as a resource.
